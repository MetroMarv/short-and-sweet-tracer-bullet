# Short and sweet

## Tracer Bullet Approach
From "The Pragmatic Programmer" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt

---

# Intro, reason & background

Ever implemented something almost till the end, only to then to notice that the last piece isn't working as expected?

The "Tracer Bullet Approach" may help with this!

---

# Tracer Bullet

* used by soldiers to track their shots in the dark
* soldiers can align their aim based on the trace


---

# In Software Development

We have
* difficult integrations
* uncertain client requiments
* implementations with lots of unknowns

Software "Tracer Bullets" to the rescue!

---

# "Code that glows in the dark"

* implement areas with risks/doubts first and minimal
* start with simple "Hello World" project
* implement a new feature first through all layers

---

# Tracer Bullet for integrations
